# About Me

Hi there! You can call me Timberfang. I've been coding on and off as a hobby for the past few years. Although I will not claim to be as skilled, experienced, or dedicated as a full-time software dev, I enjoy making tools to solve problems. I do a lot of simple automation and scripting in PowerShell, but I turn to C# for more complex projects.

- I self-host a private [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) instance on my home network. Most of my repositories on GitHub are mirrored from there, including this one!
- Besides programming, I dabble in creative writing from time to time. I'm not very good at it, but I still have fun. I generally don't publicize this work.
- I tend to be pretty private, but you can find me on Mastodon and sometimes Fur Affinity. I don't post much, but I like to lurk and see what's going on. See [Contact Me](#contact-me) below for details.
- In case it isn't obvious, I'm also a [furry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom). My fursona is a werewolf, hence the name Timberfang. :wolf:
- My profile picture was created by myself using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org). I'm not much of an artist, but I'm happy with it.

## Projects

Here are some projects I've worked on. In general, I like to create tools that solve problems I come across in my daily life. Some of these, however, were more educational than practical. Unless otherwise noted, these are all open-source under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit). I genuinely *do not care* what you use them for or how you modify them. As long as it's not malicious, have fun!

1. [MediaBox](https://github.com/Timberfang/MediaBox): My first "serious" project. This is a command-line wrapper for [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) and [libvips](https://www.libvips.org) written in C#. It can be used to transcode video, audio, and image files to other formats in bulk. Other features will be added over time.
2. [LicenseIt](https://github.com/Timberfang/LicenseIt): A simple C# console application that creates a `LICENSE` file for your project(s) from various FOSS licenses available from the [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com) website.
3. [CaesarCipher](https://github.com/Timberfang/CaesarCipher): A simple command-line Caesar cipher encoder/decoder written in C#. Mostly just for fun. **Please don't use this for real encryption! The Ceasar cipher is very easy to crack.**
4. [TicTacToe](https://github.com/Timberfang/TicTacToe): The classic game of tic-tac-toe / noughts and crosses / Xs and Os implemented in C# with a simple text-based user interface.
5. [HelperScripts](https://github.com/Timberfang/HelperScripts): A collection of small PowerShell scripts that do various tasks.
