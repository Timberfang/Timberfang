# About Me

Hi there! You can call me Timberfang. I've been coding on and off as a hobby for the past few years. Although I will not claim to be as skilled, experienced, or dedicated as a full-time software dev, I enjoy making tools to solve problems. I do a lot of simple automation and scripting in PowerShell, but I turn to C# for more complex projects.

- I self-host a private [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) instance on my home network. All my repositories on GitHub are mirrored from there, including this one!
- Besides programming, I dabble in creative writing from time to time. I'm not very good at it, but I still have fun. This work is usually not publicized.
- I tend to be pretty private, but you can find me on Mastodon and sometimes Fur Affinity. Even though I don't post much, I still like to lurk and see what's going on. See [Contact Me](#contact-me) below for details.
- In case it isn't obvious, I'm also a [furry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom). My fursona is either a wolf or werewolf (not yet decided), hence the name Timberfang. :wolf:
- My profile picture was created by myself using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org). I'm not much of an artist, admittedly, but I'm still happy with it.
